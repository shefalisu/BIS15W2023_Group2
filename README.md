## BIS15 W23 Group 2

Welcome to our repository! Our names are Ingrid, Rafael, and Shefali and we are taking the **Introduction to Data Science for Biologists** course at UC Davis. For our final project, we looked at data from the show, Shark Tank USA, to analyze the trends that could help entrepreneurs increase their chances at getting investment deals. To complete this project, we evenly divided the work among the three of us. Rafael made various graphs that showcased the main trends seen in the data set. Ingrid made graphs that analyzed the sharks and their relationship to the  main industries featured on the show. Ingrid also made the graphics and layout of the slideshow presentation. Finally, Shefali made graphs that compared the original offered equity and the actual equity the sharks got in the top three industries. 

## Thank You!
